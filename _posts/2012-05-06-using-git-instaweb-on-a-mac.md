<!-- cSpell:ignore instaweb lighttpd httpd symlinks pcre unic openssl sbin aligncenter -->

Today I discovered `git instaweb`. This is a very cool feature that allows you to instantly view your local repository (the one in your current working directory) in a web browser. <!--more--> It was incredibly easy to setup on my Mac. I did some googling and found out not everyone thinks it is so easy to setup. This is because they either don't have a web server installed or the web server that is installed (apache2) isn't installed on a Mac the way `git instaweb` expects.  

As you will see shortly, I was in good shape to use this feature because I was already using the [Homebrew Package Manager][1].

Here is what happened the first time I tried using it:

```bash
$ git instaweb
lighttpd not found. Install lighttpd or use --httpd to specify another httpd daemon.
```

Like I said I use homebrew, so whenever I see an error like this the first thing I try doing is installing the necessary software using brew:

```bash
$ brew install lighttpd
Error: You must 'brew link pkg-config' before lighttpd can be installed
```

Ok, I thought, this might be a problem, but let's just do what it is asking me to do:

```bash
$ brew link pkg-config
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pkg-config/0.25... 2 symlinks created
```

and now let's try again:

```bash
$ brew install lighttpd

```

That was it. The next time I ran `git instaweb` it started up the web server and a browser and I was viewing my code repository.
