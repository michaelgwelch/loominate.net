Rob Schmitz reporting for Marketplace catches Mike Daisey in flat out lies about what he saw during his visit to China. Daisey claims it was theater not journalism. Seems he should have thought of that before going on dozens of television programs to lie about what he saw. Listen to the Marketplace piece [here][1].

This revelation is causing lots of media outlets to have to issue retractions. Among them is one of my favorite programs, This American Life. Ira apologizes on the TAL [blog][2]. I've been a contributor and listener to TAL for years and I won't stop because of this. Like others, I found the story to not quite fit with what I had read and heard about Apple's suppliers; but I can understand that they made a mistake.

Gruber is all over this story with 7 posts at last count including this [one][3].
