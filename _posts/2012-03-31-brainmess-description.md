It occurred to me that since the [links][1] I've provided so far include a NSFW word, I should take the time to describe the Brainmess language on my blog so readers need not click on those links. This description is obviously not going to be completely original as I've stolen most of it from Mark Chu-Carroll's blog and Wikipedia.

The Brainmess language has 8 instructions each represented by a single character. Every other character in a Brainmess program is ignored and can be used for comments. 

Unlike most high-level languages, there are no named variables in the language. Instead, memory is modeled as a tape with an infinite amount of cells on it. Each cell can hold one number. (In my implementations I default each cell to have an initial value of 0.) 

At any given time one and only one of the cells of the tape is the *current* cell. One can think of there being a sensor or tape head that can be positioned over one and only one cell. Six of the 8 instructions make reference to the current cell. It is not possible to read or write any cell but the current cell.

The following table presents the eight instructions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Instruction</td> 
      
      <td>
        <b>Description</td> </tr>

          </td>
          
          <td>
            Moves the tape head forward one cell. So if the tape head prior to execution is at position $$n$$ of the tape then the tape head after execution will be at position $$n+1$$.<br /> </tr> 
            
            <tr>
              <td>
                <code><</code>
              </td>
              
              <td>
                Moves the tape head backward one cell. So if the tape head prior to execution is at position $$n$$ of the tape then the tape head after execution will be at position $$n-1$$.<br /> </tr>

                    <p>
                      While this appears to be correct to me, it is actually a little different than the Brainmess specification. Brainmess specifies that the <code>]</code> instruction test the current cell. This C implementation doesn't do that. It just jumps back to the beginning of the loop and relies on the fact that the current cell will be tested as part of the <code>while</code> condition.
