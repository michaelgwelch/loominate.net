Hello There! Welcome to my blog! I'm so bad at writing About pages. So I present to you my chatGPT generated about page.
All the text following the prompt below was AI generated.


It's so much more grandiose in its ambitions than I actually am. In actuality, I just want to try
to write about things I've found interesting and have fun learning about how to actually get
my ideas nicely formatted in Jekyll. This blog has been mostly dormant for most of it's
life. I'd like to change that.

> Write an "About Page" for my blog that is about math, computer science, software engineering, and programming languages. Take into account the tag line for my blog is inspired by Richard Feynman "try not to fool your self"

> The previous line was the prompt for the following About text
